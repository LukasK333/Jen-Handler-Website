              I offer individual psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis to adults who may
              be experiencing anxiety, depression, self-doubt, and uncertainty about the direction
              their life is heading, or who are hoping to understand more about themselves and
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a licensed clinical social worker and a contemporary relational psychoanalyst.
              I know that may sound jargony, but what it really means is that I
              believe the relationship that you and I build together is central
              to creating growth. In our work, I will focus on getting to know
              you, and, with warmth, curiosity, and compassion, will try to
              fully understand the world as you experience it. Over time, you
              will learn more about yourself, better appreciate the choices you
              make, and identify the patterns that keep showing up. This sense
              of feeling understood, along with this new insight, can empower
              you to make changes in your life and get more of the things you
              want and fewer of the things you don’t.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also work with many couples. In some ways, this process is
              similar, but it’s also a little different. With couples, I draw on
              both my relational psychoanalytic training and from the concepts
              of emotionally focused therapy (EFT), which is considered the gold standard of relationship
              therapy. We focus on the emotions that are contributing to
              disconnection in your relationship and promote empathic connection
              between you and your partner.
            </p>
            <p>
              I strongly prefer to work with people a minimum of once a week,
              and ideally, two or three times a week. I find that coming to
              therapy more frequently opens up richer avenues of exploration and
              produces faster results, but we will find an approach
              together that is individually tailored to your goals and needs.
